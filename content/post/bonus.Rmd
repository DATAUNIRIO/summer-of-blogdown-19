Here is a collection of "good ideas", brought on by a Q&A session after we finished our fourth day of "Summer of `blogdown`". A mix of advice regarding professional development, good practices, and finding your voice `r emo::ji("mega")`.

  + Alison (using the Hugo academic theme) changed `privacy.md` to [`license.md`](https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/content/license.md), so you can view my site license [here](https://alison.rbind.io/license/).

# Citation
 
Add a site `CITATION.md` in your project root directory- make sure you include plain text, BibTeX, and your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) in `CITATION.md`, and every librarian on the planet will be your new best friend. -- [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gvwilson)
  
  + In your academic-themed site, an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) logo/link is one of the social icons available to you "out of the box" with the [academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) pack (see commit here on [Kelly's site)](https://github.com/apreshill/kellykapowski/commit/e9ff46f2bb66375519a40dc0d8ba58166546fb4d):
    
  ```yaml
  - icon: orcid
    icon_pack: ai
    link: https://orcid.org
  ```
  
# Commit histories

At this point, you may be worried about other people viewing your commit history. I wouldn't worry about this too much, but here are some good resources that can help alleviate your anxiety and perhaps help you learn more about using Git/GitHub:

# Bling up your Github!

1. First, add your site's URL to the top of your repo:
    
      ![](../assets/repo-1.png)
  
      ![](../assets/repo-2.png)
  
      ![](../assets/repo-3.png)
    
1. Add a `README.md` to your repo with a Netlify deployment badge [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/cac601bf-77e4-4d7f-b4ec-db2b08829e20/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/summer-of-blogdown/deploys). From [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/01/29/sharing-the-love-with-netlify-deployment-badges/): " All you have to do is copy it from your site’s settings. The badge automatically updates to reflect the current state of your latest production deployment on Netlify. Clicking it takes you to the site’s deploy list if you’re authenticated, and to the login page otherwise."

1. Add your URL to your GitHub profile: https://github.com/settings/profile.
    
1. Add your `blogdown` project repository to your pinned repos on GitHub: https://help.github.com/en/articles/pinning-items-to-your-profile.
