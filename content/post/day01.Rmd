# Homework

Your mission, high-level, is to personalize the biography section of your new home page:

1. Open your blogdown R project, and use the serve site add-in right away. 

1. In this example site, a superuser is created with the username `admin` and corresponding user profile located at `content/authors/admin/_index.md`. Open up this `_index.md` file and update the YAML front matter plus the bio after the front matter (i.e. after the last `---` line) to create *your* profile.

1. Find a `.jpg` file you want to use as a profile photo. For best results, place a square cropped portrait photo named `avatar.jpg` into your profile folder at `content/authors/admin/`, overwriting the example image. 

1. Attempt to update your site on Netlify (doh! this is a bit of a trick `r emo::ji("wink")`).

1. Sign up for a Netlify account, using your GitHub account.

# Extra

1. Look at the default landing page for your current "out of the box" example site- scroll through the sections. Which do you like? Which do you want to cut? Make a list!

1. Look at the upper menu navbar- what menu items do you want? What is missing? Make a list!
