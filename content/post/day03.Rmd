# Homework

1. Add some type of new content in a `.Rmd` file- pick one of the academic theme's archetypes and run with it!

1. Add some R code to your content. Using a built-in dataset (bore us here), make a simple plot using your favorite plotting package (for tidyverse team members, bonus points for using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) + [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/)!)

1. Now, to that new content, embed an image. Here are some [good ones](https://unsplash.com/), if you need a quick download. Try including an image using:
    + markdown syntax, and 
    + in a code chunk using `knitr::include_graphics()`.

1. In your new content, add a link to another section of your blog, using *relative links*.

1. Finally, in an `.Rmd` file somewhere in your project, read in a data file.
