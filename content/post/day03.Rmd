```{r echo = FALSE}

# Homework

1. Follow instructions in this [blog post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/) to activate page bundles in your `blogdown` project using a project `.Rprofile` file (2 gotchas: new empty line at the end of the file, and restart R for changes to take effect).

1. In your `config.toml` file, update your `permalinks` as follows (also more advice on permalinks in this great post on a ["new post workflow"](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow/) by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://twitter.com/grrrck)):

    ```js
    [permalinks]
    # for optimists who plan to blog a lot
        post = "/post/:year/:month/:day/:slug/" 
    # for realists who know that you won't have multiple posts per day (or maybe even month)
        post = "/post/:year/:slug/" 
    ```


1. Use the new post add-in (see figure \@ref(fig:addin)) to create a new `.Rmd` post bundle and run with it! (carefully `r emo::ji("wink")` make triple-sure it is, in fact, *bundled*)

    ```{r addin, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap = "The new post add-in"}
    knitr::include_graphics("../assets/kelly-newpost.png")
    ```

1. Add some R code to your post. Using a built-in dataset (bore us here: `iris` works just fine), make a simple plot using your favorite plotting package (for tidyverse team members, bonus points for using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) + [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/)!)

1. Now, to that new post, embed a bundled image using *relative links*. Here are some [good ones](https://unsplash.com/), if you need a quick download. Try including an image using:
    + markdown syntax, and 
    + in a code chunk using `knitr::include_graphics()`.

1. In your new post, add a link to another section of your website (i.e., another section in your `content/`), using *relative links*.

1. Finally, in your new post, read in a data file (also considered part of the "bundle"!) and do something with it simple (plot, `dplyr::glimpse`, use an HTML widget like [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)).

# Extra
